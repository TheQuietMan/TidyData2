ABOUT : 
This data was derived according to the script contained in the file run_analysis.R
It was run on 27/April 2014 using data originally sourced from : 

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

as part of Coursera course : Getting and Cleaning Data (Mar/April 2014 edition)

ROWS : 
each row provides for a given subject and activity label the average value of all readings for a given feature 
   Subject Activity 1-tBodyAcc-mean()-X 
 		 2  WALKING           0.2731131 

e,g, in this fragment : Subject = 2, Activity =WALKING, the average value of the feature labelled 1-tBodyAcc-mean()-X is 0.2731131

Notes on transformation from raw data files : 
Subject : Preserved from the original data loaded. 
Activity : The original data coded each activity as seq(1:6) and via the activity_labels.txt input file these were converted thus 1-> WALKING 2-> WALKING_UPSTAIRS etc
Feature Labels : The titles were parsed thus: n-[ft][BodyGravity][AccGyro]([JerkMag])-[mean()std()]-[XYZ]

n: a number indicating the original column ordinal number in the source data file feature_labels.txt
ft : t - time-domain variable, f - freq-domain variable arising from Fast Fourier Transform 
BodyGravity : Body component of accelerometer measurements, Gravity - Gravitational component of accelerometer measurements
AccGyro : Acc - Accelerometer reading, Gyro - Gyroscope reading
(Jerk) : (not present in all columns) derivative of linear acceleration or angular velocity 
(Mag) :  (not present in all columns) magnitude of 3-dimensional signals (i.e. X, Y. Z as below) according to Euclidean norm.
XYZ : (not present in all columns) whether the signal was measured on the X,Y or Z axis

The previous columns other than n describe a signal. The next components describe the mathematical property of that signal. 
mean()std() : Mean() : mean value of all measurements of a signal during a single observation. std() : Standard deviation of a signal.

COLUMNS : 
Subject : Integer from 1 : 30; indicating the ID of the Subject. Preserved from the original data loaded. 
Activity : Text string indicating the activity being performed.
